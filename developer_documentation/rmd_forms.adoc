== RMD Forms

RMD forms are special forms for rendering on Registered Mobile Devices (RMD).

They are intentionally far simpler than Crossbeams::Layout pages. They should always be rendered inside `:layout_rmd`.

== Example

From a route:
[source,ruby]
----
details = retrieve_from_local_store(:delivery_putaway) || {}
items = %w[one two buckle my shoe]
form = Crossbeams::RMDForm.new(details,
                               form_name: :putaway,
                               progress: 'Delivery 123: 3 of 5 items complete',
                               notes: 'Please scan the Delivery and the SKU numbers.',
                               scan_with_camera: @rmd_scan_with_camera,
                               caption: 'Delivery putaway',
                               links: [{ caption: 'Cancel', url: '/back', prompt: 'Ok?' }],
                               reset_button: true,
                               step_and_total: [1, 2],
                               action: '/rmd/deliveries/putaways',
                               button_caption: 'Putaway')
form.behaviours do |behaviour|
  behaviour.keyup :quantity, notify: [{ url: '/rmd/deliveries/quantity_changed' }]
end
form.add_label(:business_process, 'Business process', 'DELIVERY')
form.add_field(:delivery_number, 'Delivery', scan: 'key248_all', scan_type: :delivery)
form.add_select(:choice, 'Choose', items: items, value: 'my', required: true, prompt: true)
form.add_field(:sku_number, 'SKU', scan: 'key248_all', scan_type: :sku)
form.add_field(:location, 'Location', scan: 'key248_all', scan_type: :location, force_uppercase: true)
form.add_field(:quantity, 'Quantity', data_type: 'number')
form.add_toggle(:complete, 'Is this functon complete?')
form.add_button('Print', '/rmd/deliveries/print', id: 'print_btn')
form.add_csrf_tag csrf_tag
view(inline: form.render, layout: :layout_rmd)

=== Method: add_toggle

This adds a checkbox to the form which renders as a toggle switch.
The toggle will be checked if the field has a value and the value is not `false` and does not start with any of these characters: `F, f, N, n, 0`.

The best way to set the value is to make the field value `true` or `false`, but any of the following: `Yes`, `no`, `t` or `False` would set the state as you would expect.

The returned parameter value is either `t` when checked or `f` when unchecked.

== Testing

See link:/developer_documentation/how_to_test_rmd_scanning.adoc[How to test RMD scanning]

== Device setup

If the seed for **rmd_mobile_setup_user** is run, a special user with the login and password `mobilesetup` is created.

This user has permission to access the menu `Utilities | Device Setup` which can be used to generate an entry in the registered mobile devices table, or just to see what ip address is assigned to the device.
