== Crossbeams framework

== Running the app

The following special environment variables are available when running the app:

* `RACK_ENV` - Defaults to `development`. Is set to `test` automatically during test runs. Must be set to `production` in production environments. It is important to remember to set the environment to `production` in cron jobs or when running Rake tasks on deployed servers.
* `NO_ERR_HANDLE` - Only applies in development mode. If set, the error_handler will not handle errors for you.
* `DONOTLOGSQL` - If set, SQL statements are not included in the application logs. Note that statements are only logged in development mode.
* `LOGSQLTOFILE` - If set, SQL will be logged to a separate file in the `log` directory.
* `LOGFULLMESSERVERCALLS` - If set, all parameters sent in a POST message to MesServer will be logged. This can be useful for debugging. The default is to log just 300 characters of the body.

---

Handy Rake prep tasks

* Run `bundle exec rake developers:setup` to setup a new developer install and to add missing environment variables to `.env.local`.
* Run `bundle exec rake developers:client_settings` to get a list of all possible environment variables and their descriptions.
* Run `bundle exec rake developers:client_settings_required` to get the same list as above, but only including **required** variables.
* Run `bundle exec rake developers:log:clear` to truncate the sql log file.
