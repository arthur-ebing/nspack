== How to work with document sequence numbers

Document numbers are numbers used to uniquely identify documents or transactions in the system.
For example a purchase order number or invoice number.
Sometimes these are just integer numbers and sometimes they are strings with text prefixes (INV000123).

These numbers use database sequences to handle incrementing; and a configuration to define how they are formatted and stored.
There is a repository method `next_document_number` that updates a row's document number.

=== Creating a sequence

NOTE: Sequence names should be prefixed with `doc_seqs_` -- e.g. `doc_seqs_invoice`. This is not a requirement, just a convention so that sequences are listed together.

Include the sequence in a migration:
[source,ruby]
----
Sequel.migration do
  up   { run 'CREATE SEQUENCE doc_seqs_invoice;' }
  down { run 'DROP SEQUENCE doc_seqs_invoice;' }
end
----

=== Setting up the configuration

Rules for generating sequences are defined in `config/document_sequence.yml`. This is a hash keyed by the document type.

Required entries are:

* `db_sequence_name` -- must match the name of a sequence in the database.
* `data_type` -- must be `:integer` or `:string`.
* `table` -- the table name.
* `column` -- the column in which the document number is stored.

Optional entries (which only apply if the data_type is `:string`) are:

* `prefix` -- A string to be placed in front of the sequence number.
* `digit_length` -- the number of digits after the prefix. These will be used to zero-pad the number.

e.g. with prefix = 'INV' and digit_length = 5, and the sequence at 44, the document number would be set to `'INV00044'`.

=== Setting the number on a row

There are two ways to do this:

* In the database with a default -- if a number is generated on create of a row (Only for integer doc numbers).
* In code -- when the number is only generated at a certain point in the row's lifetime (more typical).

==== Default declared in table definition

If the sequence is automatically generated on create of a row (and the number is stored as an integer), the column can be specified with a `DEFAULT`.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE xyz
ADD COLUMN docno integer DEFAULT nextval('doc_seqs_invoice') NOT NULL;
----

or as a migration:
[source,ruby]
----
Sequel.migration do
  up do
    alter_table(:invoices) do
      add_column :invoice_ref, Integer, default: Sequel.function(:nextval, 'doc_seqs_invoice')
      set_column_default :int_ref, Sequel.function(:nextval, 'doc_seqs_invoice')
    end
  end

  down do
    alter_table(:invoices) do
      drop_column
      set_column_default :int_ref, nil
    end
  end
end
----

==== Setting the number in code

This is as simple as passing the document type and id to a method on a repository. The method consults the document sequence configuration to work out how to run the update.
[source,ruby]
----
repo.transaction do
  repo.update_invoice(id, options)
  repo.update_with_document_number('invoice', id) if invoice_now_valid
end
----

NOTE: The `update_with_document_number` method does not return the new document number -- you'll need to query the database to get it.

==== Applying a sequence to many rows

If you need one sequence to apply to several rows, get the number from the database and then update the reords:
[source,ruby]
----
ids = some_set_of_table_ids
repo.transaction do
  seq_no = repo.next_document_sequence_number('invoice')
  repo.update(:table_name, ids, sequence_column: seq_no)
end
----
