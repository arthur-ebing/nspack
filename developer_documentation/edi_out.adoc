== EDI-OUT process

The EDI-OUT process creates an edi file from rules provided in the `edi_out_rules` table and in a few configurations.

A lot of infrastructure is provided by the framework so that transformations can be written to mostly concentrate on applying business logic.

=== Environment - variables and directories

For EDI out processes to work, the following configuration needs to be in place:

==== Fixed config (applies universally)

NOTE: This config is typically only changed in the code base when a new flow is introduced.

edi/schemas/schema_record_sizes.yml:: Stores record lengths (for flat files) or output file type for each flow type.
edi/schemas/<flow.xml>|<flow.yml>|<flow.xsd>:: Schema definition for output files - one file per flow type.
AppConst::EDI_FLOW_*:: Constants for flow types (e.g. `EDI_FLOW_PO = 'PO'` for PO flow type)
AppConst::EDI_OUT_RULES_TEMPLATE:: A hash of rules to govern the CRUD around `edi_out_rules` table.

==== YAML flow definitions for csv files

CSV files can be simply a list of column names and data types, or a list of column names with data type and headings.

[source,yml]
----
:col1: :string    <1>
:col2: :text      <2>
:col3: :decimal   <3>
----
<1> `:string` works for all columns.
<2> `:text` is used for long numbers and plcaes a single quote in front.
<3> Use `:decimal` for a numeric column to prevent it being written in scientific notation.


The other way of specifying columns allows you to provide a different heading:
[source,yml]
----
:puc:
  :type: :string
  :head: PUC
----

==== Client-specific config

NOTE: This config is set up per client.

edi_out_rules table:: Table that stores destinations for each flow type. There is a UI CRUD environment for maintaining this table. See menu item `EDI | Config | OUT Rules`.
Environment variable `EDI_NETWORK_ADDRESS`:: The client's EDI network address.
config/edi_out_config.yml:: Stores file path rules - see structure below.

A typical folder structure would look something like this and `edi_out_config` would point to it:

----
ftp_transfer/
├── edi_out
│   ├── head_office      #<1>
│   │   ├── errors
│   │   ├── receive
│   │   ├── transmit
│   │   └── transmitted
│   └── paltrack         #<1>
│       ├── errors
│       ├── receive
│       ├── transmit
│       └── transmitted
└── email_out            #<2>
----
<1> Keys that match entries in config.
<2> Folder where email out files are generated before being attached to emails.

=== Structure of edi_out_config.yml

This file is named `config/edi_out_config.yml`. In deployed systems it is in `shared/config`.

The keys in `:out_dirs` and `:mail_recipients` are used in the EDI out rules CRUD to select targets for EDI files.

An example:
[source,yaml]
----
:root: "$HOME/ftp_transfer"                  #<1>
:email_dir: "$ROOT/edi_mail_out"             #<2>
:send_edi:
  :po: false                                 #<3>
  :ps: true                                  #<4>
:out_dirs:
  :paltrack: "$ROOT/edi_out/paltrack"        #<5>
  :head_office: "$ROOT/edi_out/head_office"
:mail_recipients:
  :ajax:                                     #<6>
    :to: person1@place.com,person2@place.com #<7>
    :cc: someone@here.com                    #<8>
  :bjax:
    :to: person1@place.com,person2@place.com
    :subject: Attention, EDI file attached   #<9>
  :cjax:
    :to: person1@place.com,person2@place.com
    :subject:
      PO: PO attached - load $:load_id$, container: $:container_code$ for order $:customer_order_no$ #<10>
----
<1> The directory under which all other out directories live.
<2> All files to be sent by mail will be written to this directory.
<3> The sending of a flow type can be switched off by setting this to false.
<4> If this is not true, the flow type will not be sent.
<5> These keys match the name in the folder structure - see previous section. Not the use of `$ROOT` as a shortcut.
<6> This is a mail key. There can be several.
<7> The email addresses that will receive the file for `mail:ajax` target. A comma-separated list. No spaces.
<8> The `cc` is typically used to send a copy of the file to someone on site. A comma-separated list. No spaces.
<9> The default mail subject is `"<FLOW-TYPE> file attached"` but can be overridden with a string.
<10> The subject can also be specified as a hash with a value for each flow type. For `(9)` and `(10)`, if no subject is found, the default is used. Certain tokens can be replaced in the subject - `$:load_id$`, `$:customer_order_no$`, `$:container_code$`. Note that not all flows will produce values for every token.

=== Starting an EDI process

An EDI OUT process is kicked off from code (e.g. PO when a load is shipped) or from a rake task (e.g. a cron schedule will fire a PS flow).

The `EdiApp::SendEdiOut` service does some preparation (including deciding if an edi can run or not) and kicks off a job (`EdiApp::Job::SendEdiOut`) which loads the particular flow service to do the processing and calls it.

The flow looks like this:

Code / Rake task -> `EdiApp::SendEdiOut` -> `EdiApp::Job::SendEdiOut` -> FlowOut service

=== Calling the SendEdiOut service

Pass in the following parameters to `EdiApp::SendEdiOut.call()`:

flow_type:: EDI out flow to be generated.
party_role_id:: The party_role_id if the flow is generate for a party role, else `nil`. (e.g. a PS for a marketing org)
user_name:: The `users.user_name` of 'System' if the transform is not initiated by a user.
record_id:: The id of a record if the flow is generated from a particular resource. (e.g. PO will use `loads.id`)

=== Implementing an EDI-OUT Service

The service to process a file inherit from `BaseEdiOutService`.

The `initialize` method **must** implement the call to `super` at a minimum:
[source,ruby]
----
def initialize(edi_out_transaction_id, logger)
  super(AppConst::EDI_FLOW_xx, edi_out_transaction_id, logger)
end
----

All processing must be implemented via the `call` method.

==== Variables available from the `BaseEdiOutService`

flow_type:: The flow type of this process (`PO`, `LI` etc.)
record_id:: The id of the resource being processed (e.g. `loads.id` for a PO)
party_role_id:: The id of the party_role in use (e.g. marketing org for a PO)
record_entries:: A Hash to be filled with data for output. For flat files, add arrays per row type, for csf files, add an array per the flow type. Adding records is typically done via a helper method, not by directly manipulating this object.

==== Methods available from the `BaseEdiOutService`

validate_data(identifiers, check_lengths = false):: Validate data for a flat file EDI against the flow's schema. Limit to certain identifiers.
build_hash_from_data(rec, rec_id):: Builds up a hash from a query `rec` and adds it to `record_entries[rec_id]`.
add_record(record_type, rec = {}):: Add a hash to `record_entries` for `record_type`.
create_flat_file:: creates the flat file from `record_entries`.
add_csv_record(rec):: add a csv formatted record to `record_entries` from the `rec` hash.
create_csv_file:: creates the csv file from `record_entries`.
log(msg):: Write `msg` to the log file at the `info` level.
log_err(msg):: Write `msg` to the log file at the `error` level.
