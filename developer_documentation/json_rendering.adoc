= JSON rendering

This doc shows which helpers are available in route files to return JSON responses to update the page without reloading.

== Updating a dialog

=== Replace the contents of a dialog

Renders the text in `:content` in the current dialog's body.

    update_dialog_content(content:, notice: nil, error: nil)

=== Change the contents of a dialog by loading another URL

Replaces the current dialog's content with the response from `url`.

    load_via_json(url, notice: nil)

=== Change the contents of a window by loading another URL

Replaces the current window's content with the response from `url`.
This should be used in the response to a link loaded in a "loading_window" (see Link: `loading_window` option).

`log_url` will log the passed url to the console. (Usually set this to `request.path`). This can help with debugging.

Use the `download` option if the route will return a file for download. Otherwise the loading window continues
to show that it is loading after the file has been downloaded.

    change_window_location_via_json(new_location, log_url = nil, download: false)

=== Redirect to the last grid

This uses a redirect to load the page that rendered the last grid.

    redirect_to_last_grid(route)

=== Redirect to a URL

Pass the URL and the app will redirect to it.

  redirect_via_json(url)

=== Redirect to either a grid or page (using stored referer)

Sometimes a page can be launched from a grid or from one or more other pages and after some action has been taken, you want to redirect to the appropriate page.

To do this, from the _launched_ page route, call:

  store_last_referer_url(key)

This will store the referer URL (the page that launched this page/dialog) in local storage.

Then when you want to redirect back, call:

  redirect_via_json_to_stored_referer(key)

NOTE: `key` in both cases is a `Symbol`.

=== Reload the dialog that opened the current dialog

When a dialog opens another dialog, you might want to close the second dialog and then reload (refresh) the first dialog with the response from the original or another URL.

    reload_previous_dialog_via_json(url, notice: nil)

=== Close the dialog and update the grid

After a grid action opens a dialog and changes are saved from the dialog, you might want to update certain values on the current row without reloading the page.

    update_grid_row(ids, changes:, grid_id: nil, notice: nil, error: nil)

id:: is the id of the row to change, but can also be an array of ids if you want to update several rows with the same changes.
changes:: is a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.
grid_id:: an _optional_ string providing the grid's DOM id. Not required for actions fired from a grid or from a link that specifies the grid id.
notice:: an _optional_ string message to display as information.
error:: an _optional_ string message to display as an error.

=== Close the dialog and add a row to the grid

Like with updating a grid row, this will close the dialog and append a row to the underlying grid.

    add_grid_row(attrs:, grid_id: nil, notice: nil)

attrs:: is a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.
grid_id:: an _optional_ string providing the grid's DOM id. Not required for actions fired from a grid or from a link that specifies the grid id.
notice:: an _optional_ string message to display as information.

`add_grid_row` will automatically set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the new row if the grid has them (so they do not need to be included int the `attrs` Hash).

The newly-added row will be scrolled into view if necessary.

== Changing DOM elements

The main helper for this is `json_actions` which receives:

* an array of actions to be carried out in the page
* an optional flash message to be displayed
* an optional flag to indicate that a dialog should not be closed after processing the response in the page
* an optional flash error to be displayed

Each action is of a specific type which tells the calling javascript what to do.

e.g.

json_actions(actions, message = nil, keep_dialog_open: false, error: nil)

json_actions([OpenStruct.new(type: :replace_multi_options,
                             dom_id: 'product_code_columns_product_code_column_ids',
                             options_array: res.instance[:code]),
              OpenStruct.new(type: :replace_input_value,
                             dom_id: 'product_code_columns_chosen_column_ids',
                             value: ids.join(','))],
             'Re-assigned product columns')

json_actions(array_of_actions, error: "There was a problem, but we've still updated the row")

=== Actions

==== Replace the value of an input element

Works on `input` elements (including hidden or disabled ones).

type:: `:replace_input_value`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the input element in the page. This is usually a combination of the `form_name` and `field_name`.
e.g. if a form named `users` has a field named `surname`, then the dom_id will be `users_surname`.

value:: the value you want to change it to.

==== Change the value of a select element

Works on `select` elements.

type:: `:change_select_value`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the select element in the page. This is usually a combination of the `form_name` and `field_name`.
e.g. if a form named `users` has a field named `surname`, then the dom_id will be `users_surname`.

value:: the value of the option you want to be selected.

==== Replace the URL of a DOM element

Works on DOM elements (basically for anchors).

type:: `:replace_url`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page.

value:: the value you want to change it to.

==== Replace the inner HTML of a DOM element

Works on DOM elements (usually for label text).

type:: `:replace_inner_html`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page.

value:: the value you want to change it to.

==== Replace the contents of a dialog

Works when loading a new popup dialog.

type:: `:replace_dialog`.

content:: the content for the dialog.

title:: the title of the dialog.

==== Launch a new dialog with content

Use this to launch a new dialog with content from the server.

type:: `:launch_dialog`.

content:: the content for the dialog.

title:: (optional) the dialog title. Defaults to blank.

NOTE: For this action, you **must** specify `keep_dialog_open: true`. Or use `json_launch_dialog` which defaults to keeping the dialog open.

==== Replace the options in a multi element

Works on `Multi.js` elements only.

type:: `:replace_multi_options`.

dom_id:: as for `:replace_input_value`.

options_array:: A one- or two-dimensional array.

==== Replace the options in a select element

Works on `Selectr.js` elements only.

type:: `replace_select_options`

dom_id:: as for `:replace_input_value`.

options_array:: A one- or two-dimensional array.

==== Replace the items in a list element

Works on `ol` or `ul` elements only.

type:: `:replace_list_items`.
dom_id:: as for `:replace_input_value`.
items:: An array of `Strings`. This should be an array of arrays if the list is rendered with `remove_item_url`.
The first element of the array displays as the list item text, while the second is the id value that becomes part of the URL when the user clicks the icon to remove an item.

==== Set the readOnly attribute of an input

Works on a DOM input element with an id.

type:: `:set_readonly`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the input element in the page.

readonly:: (true or false) - if true, the input will be set to readOnly. if false, the input will become editable.

==== Set the required attribute of an input

Works on a DOM input element with an id.

type:: `:set_required`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the input element in the page.

required:: (true or false) - if true, the input will be set to required. if false, the required attribute will be removed from the input.

==== Set the checked attribute of an input

Works on a DOM checkbox element with an id.

type:: `:set_checked`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the checkbox element in the page.

checked:: (true or false) - if true, the `checked` attribute on the checkbox will be set. if false, it will be unset.

==== Hide a DOM element

Works on any DOM element with an id.

type:: `:hide_element`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page. This will typically be the id of the field_wrapper of an input. (See note below).

reclaim_space:: (optional, defaults to true) - if true, the page will repaint to use the hidden area. If not, the hidden element will become a blank area in the page. This is generally better in order to stop inputs from moving around on the page too much.

NOTE: To hide a form element when a page is first displayed, set the `:hide_on_load` attribute of its renderer to true.

==== Show a DOM element

Works on any DOM element with an id.

type:: `:show_element`.

dom_id:: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page. This will typically be the id of the field_wrapper of an input. (See note below).

reclaim_space:: (optional, defaults to true) - if true, the page will rearange to accomodate the shown area. If not, the element will become visible in the already-blank area in the page. This is generally better in order to stop inputs from moving around on the page too much.

NOTE: _wrapper_id_ : If a field is named `name` in a form named `users`, the input field's id will be `users_name` and the div surrounding the input and label will have the id `users_name_field_wrapper`.

==== Clear validation error messages from a form

Clears all UI text and styling from validation errors of a particular form.

type:: `:clear_form_validation`.

dom_id:: the `id` of the `<form>`. (Use `form.form_id 'abc'` in the view to set this value)

==== Add a row to a grid

As part of a set of actions, adds a row to a grid.

type:: `:add_grid_row`.
attrs:: a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.
grid_id:: an _optional_ string providing the grid's DOM id. Not required for actions fired from a grid or from a link that specifies the grid id.

==== Update a grid row

As part of a set of actions, updates the columns of a row or rows in a grid.

type:: `:update_grid_row`.

ids:: the id (or Array of ids) of the row(s) to change.
changes:: a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.
grid_id:: an _optional_ string providing the grid's DOM id. Not required for actions fired from a grid or from a link that specifies the grid id.

==== Delete a grid row

type:: `:delete_grid_row`.

id:: the id of the row to delete.
grid_id:: an _optional_ string providing the grid's DOM id. Not required for actions fired from a grid or from a link that specifies the grid id.

=== Single actions

There are also helper methods available that are easier to use when only returning a singe action.
These work exactly the same as for their counterparts above.

== Other responses

== Empty (blank) response

When there is no need to do anything at all, you can return a plain JSON success response.

  blank_json_response

This merely responds with status `200`.

== Undo an inline edit of a grid column

Undo an inline-edit from a grid (e.g. when a validation fails). Optionally display a message.

  undo_grid_inline_edit(message: nil, message_type: :warning)

* `message` is an optional message to display.
* `message_type` is the message style which can be `:info`, `:error`, `:warning` or `:notice`. Defaults to `:warning`.

[source,ruby]

res = interactor.method_that_could_fail(params)
if res.success
  # ..
