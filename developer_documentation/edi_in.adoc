== EDI-IN process

The EDI-IN process receives an edi file (typically from ftp, but sometimes also dropped in a folder from an email attachment), validates and processes it.

A lot of infrastructure is provided by the framework so that transformations can be written to mostly concentrate on applying business logic.

=== Environment - variables and directories

The `EDI_RECEIVE_DIR` environment variable is required to identify the folder from which EDI files are processed.
e.g. `EDI_RECEIVE_DIR=/home/nspack/edi_in/receive`.

A typical folder structure would look something like this:

----
nsack
├── edi_filedrop                #<1>
├── edi_in
│   ├── processed               #<2>
│   ├── process_errors          #<3>
│   └── receive                 #<4>
└─── ftp_transfer
     └─── edi_in
          ├── paltrack
          │   ├── errors
          │   ├── receive       #<5>
          │   ├── transmit
          │   └── transmitted
          └── um_clients
              ├── errors
              ├── receive       #<6>
              ├── transmit
              └── transmitted
----
<1> A dir where files can be dropped from emails.
<2> Where a file is moved after successful processing.
<3> Where a file is moved after unsuccessful processing.
<4> Where files are copied to by the EDI receive script.
<5> An example of where a file received via ftp sould be dropped.
<6> Another ftp receive example.

Scheduled jobs check dirs **(1)**, **(5)** and **(6)** and move the files to **(4)** while generating an edi receive job.

=== Scheduled jobs

These are typically kicked off in `cron` - e.g.:
[source,bash]
----
# EDI IN
*/1 * * * * cd $HOME/nspack/current && RACK_ENV=production chruby-exec 2.5.5 -- ruby scripts/base_script.rb EdiReceiveCheck $HOME/ftp_transfer/edi_in/um_clients/receive
*/1 * * * * cd $HOME/nspack/current && RACK_ENV=production chruby-exec 2.5.5 -- ruby scripts/base_script.rb EdiReceiveCheck $HOME/edi_filedrop
----
The example above runs two cron jobs every minute - one to check an ftp dir and one to check an email drop dir.

Each job runs the EDI receive script:
[source,bash]
----
ruby scripts/base_script.rb EdiReceiveCheck <dir_name>
----
This checks the directory for any newly received EDI files and for each one found, moves the file to `EDI_RECEIVE_DIR` and creates a job to process it.

=== Receive Job

The receive job is `EdiApp::Job::ReceiveEdiIn`.

This job creates a record in `edi_in_transformations` table, figures out the flow type (PO, LI etc.) and using the flow type instantiates an appropriate service to process the file.
The service is named from the flow type -- so a `PO` file will be handled by `EdiApp::PoIn` and an `LI` file will be handled by `EdiApp::LiIn`.

=== EDI-IN Service

The service to process a file inherits from `BaseEdiInService`.

The `initialize` method **must** implement the following at a minimum:
[source,ruby]
----
def initialize(edi_in_transaction_id, file_path, logger, edi_result)
  super(edi_in_transaction_id, file_path, logger, edi_result)
end
----

All processing must be implemented via the `call` method which should implement a structure like this:
[source,ruby]
----
def call
  # For flat files, check all required fields are present:
  missing_required_fields(only_rows: 'OP')
  # (For XML files, this has already been handled).

  # Set the match_data variable (for matching to older edis): (see note below)
  match_data_on(data)

  if there_are_missing_masterfiles # however this is implemented..
    missing_masterfiles_detected(notes_describing_what_is_missing)
    return failed_response('Missing masterfiles', notes_describing_what_is_missing)
  end

  # Check that the data conforms to business rules and if it does:
  business_validation_passed

  # Optionally: check if there are discrepancies in the data
  # If there are:
  discrepancies_detected('optionally more context here')
  return failed_response('Discrepancies detected')

  # Do the work to create/update data..

  success_response('PO processed')
end
----

[NOTE]
====
**Match data** -- mark older EDI as _newer_edi_received_

Set this to a value that uniquely identifies the data in the file. This is used to check if there are outstanding edi-in transactions for the same data. If there are matches, those records have their `newer_edi_received` and `reprocessed` flags set to true. (This might need to be set to a hash of a combination of fields)

If there is no unique value (e.g. for a list of pallets), set it to a comma-separated list (e.g. pallet numbers) and the logic will apply if *any* of the elements in the list match.

**NB** Use the helper function `prepare_array_for_match(array)` to convert an array to match data.

==== Variables available from the `BaseEdiInService`

flow_type:: The flow type of this process (`PO`, `LI` etc.)
file_name:: The name of the file being processed (does not include the path)
edi_records:: The file contents presented as a Ruby structure (`Array` for flat files and `Hash` for XML files)

==== Methods available from the `BaseEdiInService`

missing_required_fields(only_rows: nil):: (For flat files) Checks if any required fields are missing. Raises an exception if they are. If this passes, `edi_in_transaction.schema_valid` will be `true`.
log(msg):: Write `msg` to the log file at the `info` level.
log_err(msg):: Write `msg` to the log file at the `error` level.
newer_edi_received(notes = nil):: Set the `edi_in_transaction.newer_edi_recived` column to `true` and optionally set the `notes` column.
missing_masterfiles_detected(notes):: Set the `edi_in_transaction.has_missing_master_files` column to `true` and set the `notes` column.
business_validation_passed:: Set the `edi_in_transaction.valid` column to `true`.
discrepancies_detected(notes):: Set the `edi_in_transaction.discrepancies_detected` column to `true` and set the `notes` column.
