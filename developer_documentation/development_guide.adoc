== Development Guide

This project has some non-negotiable rules for development and some guidelines which can be followed a bit more loosely.

=== Gem reference

==== Crossbeams gems

==== External gems

Rodauth:: Manage login, logout and current user - link:[rodauth]
Sequel:: Database ORM - link:http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/documentation.html[sequel]
Dry::Struct:: Define data entities - link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-struct/[dry-struct]
Dry::Validation:: Define rules for validating inputs - link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-validation/[dry-validation]
Minitest:: Test runnner - link:https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest[minitest]
MessageBus:: Async message bus - https://github.com/SamSaffron/message_bus

==== Javascript libraries

AG Grid:: Agnostic javascript data grid. - link:https://www.ag-grid.com/documentation-main/documentation.php[AG Grid]
A11Y Modal Dialog:: Popup dialog (special version that blocks "close with ESC") - link:https://github.com/edenspiekermann/a11y-dialog[a11y-dialog]

==== CSS

Tachyons:: functional css - link:https://tachyons.io/[Tachyons]

Most classes in code should be tachyons classes (e.g. `class="b blue br3"` (read: bold, blue, border-radius 3) translates to this css: `font-weight: bold`, `color: blue` `border-radius: .5rem`).
Custom css should only be written if tachyons does not cover the desired outcome.

==== Other

Jasper Reports:: Reporting environment written in Java - https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library
Jruby Jasper:: Reporting engine to run Jasper reports - https://github.com/NoSoft-SA/jruby_jasper (Uses `drb` to send report requests)
Shared Config:: Distributed ruby app that provides shared configuration - https://github.com/NoSoft-SA/shared_config (provides variable definitions for label designing)

=== Ruby code

Use link:https://github.com/postmodern/chruby[chruby] to run the correct version of Ruby for the project.


IMPORTANT: Follow the link:/developer_documentation/coding_principles.adoc[Coding principles].

Use link:https://www.rubocop.org/[rubocop] to lint code.

Rubocop follows the style guide found at link:https://rubystyle.guide[Ruby Style Guide] with some overrides specified in `.rubocop.yml`.

Code should have no rubocop errors or warnings before being checked in.

Running rubocop (ideally integrate it in your IDE/editor so it runs in real-time while you write code):
[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake rubocop

# This will fix "fixable" violations, but check the changed code carefully
# as it may not always be 100% correct:
bundle exec rake rubocop:auto_correct

# To check a particular set of directories or files:
bundle exec rubocop lib routes config/deploy.rb
----

==== Logging changes and versions

In the root of the project are two files named `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`. These must be updated when appropriate to track significant changes.

Here's an example of some CHANGELOG entries:

.CHANGELOG.md
[source,markdown]
----
# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres roughly to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New Setting: EDI_OUT_TARGET. This should be set to a valid URL to be called with output from EDI processes.
### Changed
### Fixed
- Bug with display of labels. If content is null, the label was not displaying at full height.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-02-01
### Added
- Maintain printers.
### Changed
- User name displayed on page headers instead of user login.

## [0.5.0] - 2018-12-03
### Added
- Job queue for invoice completion. Sends an email to address(es) in INV_EMAIL setting.
----

The version file content is simple. There must be an entry in `CHANGELOG.md` every time the `VERSION` changes.

.VERSION
----
0.1.0
----
This follows link:http://semver.org/[symantic versioning] somewhat - where the version is made up of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH numbers.
Generally smallish changes should increment the PATCH number, larger changes increment the MINOR number and significant changes (typically where something is no longer backwards-compatible) increment the MAJOR number.

The VERSION number is displayed in the web page heading.

Notes to come for:

* deploy
* migrations (default values for booleans, audit log, created/updated etc)
* scaffold
* testing
* philosophy - repo, entities, separation of code etc.

=== Javascript

The Crossbeams framework tries to wrap all javascript in configuration so if there is some javascript behaviour required, it should be written into the framework and not become client code.

Use link:https://eslint.org/[ESLint] to lint code. Explanations for rule violations can be found link:https://eslint.org/docs/rules/[here].
The rules in use are based on the link:https://github.com/airbnb/javascript[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide] and further refined by the rules in `.eslint.js`.

=== Source Code Management

Code is versioned using link:https://git-scm.com/[git] and stored centrally via link:https://github.com/NoSoft-SA/[github].

All Crossbeams framework code follows the link:https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[git flow] branching model where no work is done on the master branch directly.

Developers work on feature branches based on the `develop` branch, the `develop` branch is merged into `master` and `master` is deployed via `capistrano`.

All work should be developed in feature branches and pull requests generated in github. Pull requests are evaluated, tested and merged into the `develop` branch when complete.

There are times when a developer might need to work on a hotfix branch based off `master` to make a small urgent fix.
A good tool to use on the commandline for this is link:https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/wiki[git-flow].

Other useful git tools:

* link:https://jonas.github.io/tig/[tig]
* link:https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk[gitk]

=== Aliases

These aliases can be useful during development.

==== brake

A shortcut for running `rake` without having to prefix with `bundle exec`.
[source,bash]
alias brake='bundle exec rake'

==== checkp

Searches source code for debugging `p` or `puts` statements.

[source,bash]
alias checkp="ag '\s(p|puts)\s' lib helpers routes test"

NOTE: There will be some false positives (e.g. in `error_helpers.rb` -- where we want to log an error and in `menu_repo.rb` -- where some SQL code includes `p` as an alias).

==== gitfiles

Lists files that have not been committed. Zip them with `gitfiles | zip afile.zip -@` or open all in vim with `vim $(gitfiles)`.
[source,bash]
alias gitfiles="git status -su | awk '{sub(/^(R.*-> )|[ M?]+/,\"\")};1' | awk '!/^D/'"

==== testfile

Run the tests defined in one file only. Run: `testfile test/test_base_repo.rb`.
[source,bash]
alias testfile="bundle exec ruby -Ilib:test $1"
