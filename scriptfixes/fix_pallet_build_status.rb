# frozen_string_literal: true

# What this script does:
# ----------------------
# Fix pallets where the build status is not correct based on the cartons per pallet and no of cartons on the pallet.
#
# Reason for this script:
# -----------------------
# The trigger on pallet sequences that leads to the re-calculation of the pallet build status had a bug
# which caused the wrong cartons per pallet id to be used to find the required cartons per pallet amount.
# This meant that the comparison of total cartons to required cartons per pallet was almost always wrong
# and so the status was usually set incorrectly.
